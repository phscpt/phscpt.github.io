                    ~oOoOoO~
                    We celebrate Halloween with some spooky problems!
                    <br><br>
                    If you had trouble during today's contest, remember that competitive programming is more than just coding.
                    Spend some time thinking about the problem before jumping into VSCode! Try drawing a diagram, or working through the sample cases.<br><br>
                    Next week is the team selection test for PClassic and UC Berkeley. We'll be posting details shortly. See you guys soon!

                    We had a great competition today! It was a lot of fun to watch everyone solve the problems, and we hope all of you learned something from the experience!<br><br>
