                    The link to the Team Selection Test for upcoming contests will be available shortly. The test will be open
                    on CPT Platform from <b>March 13th at 3:20pm</b> and close on <b>March 14th at 3:20pm</b>. You will have the full 24 hours
                    to complete 4 problems; each problem is designed such that one test case is brute-forceable and
                    the other requires a more sophisticated solution. Good luck!

                <p>
                    The <a href="http://usaco.org/">USA Computing Olympiad</a> is this weekend (it's four hours, and you can take it anytime between Friday and Monday). I really encourage you to go if you can!
                    <br><br>
                    You'll need to create an account to take the contest. Please do this soon because there are often problems with confirmation emails.

                    <a href="https://adventofcode.com">Advent of Code</a> will be running throughout the month of December, with increasingly difficult challenges posted each day. I highly recommend to use this for practice, because the problems are actually really good (and fun, too). To join our leaderboard, use the code <code>1823080-6ad0f2e4</code>.

                    If you had trouble during today's contest, remember that competitive programming is more than just coding.
                    Spend some time thinking about the problem before jumping into VSCode! Try drawing a diagram, or working through the sample cases.<br><br>
                    Next week is the team selection test for PClassic and UC Berkeley. We'll be posting details shortly. See you guys soon!
